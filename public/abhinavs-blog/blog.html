<!-- 
Functionality: 
A blog section of the website which takes in a function
and through that function we can write blogs (which will just be divs)
that we can add onto the website, it will be an array that we can edit
later on too, editing the blogs will only be acessible to the person who
has the login id & password. We can edit the array and hence change the
blog history too, we can later on put the array database onto the database
and into a server which will store our database, this will be secure later on.

 -->

<!-- 
Have an edit button at the bottom of the blog page which when clicked
prompts an alert to sign in and after signing in we are given an interface which
shows the array of the blogs, which we can edit.

        Adding blog functionality:-
        An "Add" button at the bottom of the page, where after putting the correct
        login id and password I see a section of the page appear, where I can add new blogs from
        this can be done with adding an extra div when I enter the correct login id and pass
        then through that div, with the inputs fields im able to enter the fields/parameters previously thought
        which has a date, time, headline, about, technology related too, etc. Then through those
        fields im able to click another button "Save", and it will save the new blog into the database.

        Editing blog functionality:-
        After clicking the "Edit" button I can then choose the index number or the headline of the blog, we can implement
        a string search algorithm which finds the headline of the blog from just a simple word we enter in the parameter 
        of the search bar, after it finds the headline, it shows the contents of the blog in the input fields now and I can edit it,
        after im done editing I can click "Save".
