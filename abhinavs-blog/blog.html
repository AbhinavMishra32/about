<!-- 
Functionality: 
A blog section of the website which takes in a function
and through that function we can write blogs (which will just be divs)
that we can add onto the website, it will be an array that we can edit
later on too, editing the blogs will only be acessible to the person who
has the login id & password. We can edit the array and hence change the
blog history too, we can later on put the array database onto the database
and into a server which will store our database, this will be secure later on.

 -->

<!-- 
Have an edit button at the bottom of the blog page which when clicked
prompts an alert to sign in and after signing in we are given an interface which
shows the array of the blogs, which we can edit.
